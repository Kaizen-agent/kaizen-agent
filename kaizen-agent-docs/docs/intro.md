# Introduction to Kaizen Agent

**Test, debug, and improve your AI agents automatically.** Kaizen Agent runs your agents, analyzes failures, and fixes code and prompts using AI.

## What is Kaizen Agent?

Kaizen Agent acts as an AI debugging engineer that continuously tests, analyzes, and improves your AI agents and LLM applications. Instead of manually writing test cases and debugging failures, you simply:

1. Define your test inputs and evaluation criteria in YAML
2. Run `kaizen test-all --auto-fix`
3. Let Kaizen automatically test, analyze failures, and improve your code

## How It Works

![Kaizen Agent Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kaizen-agent/kaizen-agent/main/kaizen_agent_workflow.png)

Kaizen Agent works by:

1. **Running your AI agent** with various test inputs
2. **Analyzing the results** using AI-powered evaluation
3. **Identifying issues** in code, prompts, or logic
4. **Automatically fixing problems** by improving prompts and code
5. **Re-testing** to ensure improvements work

## When to Use Kaizen Agent

**Kaizen Agent is most valuable during the development phase of your AI agents, right after you've written the initial code but before deployment.**

### Perfect Timing: Pre-Deployment Testing & Tuning

After writing your agent code, you typically need to:
- **Test with various inputs** to ensure reliability
- **Tweak prompts** for better performance  
- **Debug edge cases** and failure scenarios
- **Optimize code** based on test results

**Kaizen Agent automates this entire process.**

### Ideal Use Cases

- **üîÑ Iterative Development**: Test and improve agents during development cycles
- **üöÄ Pre-Deployment Validation**: Ensure your agent works reliably before going live
- **üêõ Bug Detection**: Catch and fix issues you might miss with manual testing
- **üìà Performance Optimization**: Continuously improve prompts and code based on test results
- **üõ°Ô∏è Quality Assurance**: Maintain high standards as your agent evolves

### When NOT to Use

- **Production environments** - Kaizen is for development/testing, not live systems
- **Simple, stable agents** - If your agent is already working perfectly, you might not need it
- **Non-AI applications** - Kaizen is specifically designed for AI agents and LLM applications

## Key Benefits

### üéØ No Test Code Required
Kaizen Agent uses YAML configuration instead of traditional test files:
- **‚ùå Traditional approach**: Write test files with `unittest`, `pytest`, or `jest`
- **‚úÖ Kaizen approach**: Define tests in YAML - no test code needed!

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Testing
- Automatically generates test cases based on your agent's purpose
- Uses AI to evaluate responses for quality, accuracy, and relevance
- Identifies edge cases you might miss

### üîß Automatic Fixes
- Improves prompts based on test failures
- Fixes code issues automatically
- Creates pull requests with improvements

### üìä Detailed Analytics
- Comprehensive test reports
- Before/after comparisons
- Performance metrics and trends

## üß† Traditional Software Engineering vs. AI Agent Development

### üõ† Traditional Software Engineering
- You write deterministic code.
- Then you write test code (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).
- You run the tests to check pass/fail status.
- If a test fails, you debug the logic, fix the code, and re-run the tests.

> üîÅ This is a structured, predictable feedback loop.

---

### ü§ñ AI Agent / LLM Application Development
- You build non-deterministic agents using prompts and LLM calls.
- You can't write traditional test code ‚Äî behavior varies.
- Instead, you:
  1. Prepare a test dataset (inputs + expected outputs)
  2. Manually run the agent
  3. Evaluate the outputs yourself
  4. Tweak the prompt or agent logic
  5. Repeat

> ‚ùå This is time-consuming and subjective ‚Äî like debugging a black box.

---

### üîß Kaizen Agent: Your AI Debugging Engineer
Kaizen Agent automates the test-and-improve loop, acting like a reinforcement learning system for AI agents.

- Define test inputs, expected outputs, and evaluation criteria in YAML.
- Kaizen runs your agent and evaluates the result using LLMs.
- If the result fails:
  - It auto-fixes the code or prompt.
  - Re-runs the test until it passes.
- (Optionally) creates a pull request with the improvements.
