# 🚧 Limitations & Future Plans

Kaizen Agent is evolving rapidly, but it's important to understand what it can and can't do today — and where it's going.

## Current Progress

| Feature | Python | LlamaIndex | LangChain | CrewAI | Mastra |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Single Input + Single Output | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Multiple Inputs | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Async Support | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Track Values | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Browser Agent | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Advanced Tools | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Non-text Input/Output | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Multi-turn Conversations | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Multi-agents | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Legend:**
- ✅ = Fully Supported
- ❌ = Not Yet Supported
- 🔄 = In Development

Our long-term vision is to create an **AI development teammate** that accelerates LLM development automatically, so humans can focus on building features — and Kaizen Agent handles everything else to reach production-level reliability.
